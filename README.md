# AI-Agent-Based-Customer-Support-System-For-Hotel-Using-RAG

## Introduction 💡

**AI-Agent-Based-Customer-Support-System-For-Hotel-Using-RAG** is an extensible proof-of-concept that combines autonomous AI agents with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver fast, accurate, and context-aware customer support for hotels. By grounding generative responses in hotel-specific documents (policies, FAQs, reservation records, and local knowledge), the system reduces hallucinations and ensures consistent, trustworthy interactions across booking, guest inquiries, and service requests. Designed for real-world integration, it supports seamless connectivity with property management systems and messaging channels, enabling automated resolution of routine tasks while escalating complex issues to human staff when needed.
